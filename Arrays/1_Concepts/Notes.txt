Arrays
1 min
Organizing and storing data is a foundational concept of programming.

One way we organize data in real life is by making lists. Let’s make one here:

New Year's Resolutions:

1. Keep a journal 
2. Take a falconry class
3. Learn to juggle
Let’s now write this list in JavaScript, as an array:

let newYearsResolutions = ['Keep a journal', 'Take a falconry class', 'Learn to juggle'];

strings
, numbers, and booleans). Like lists, arrays are ordered, meaning each item has a numbered position.

Here’s an array of the concepts we’ll cover:

let concepts = ['creating arrays', 'array structures', 'array manipulation'];


By the end of this lesson you’ll have another tool under your belt that helps you manage chunks of data!
